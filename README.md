cardmarket-bulk-import
===

This extension allows you to use a CSV file to fill the "List bulk items" option in Cardmarket.

Download it on the [Chrome Webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cardmarket-bulk-import/lbjpmgmfhmgaenclkmfjfompieopaimb) or [Firefox's addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cardmarket-bulk-import/).

## Common questions

### Will this extension handle multiple rows of the same card?
**Yes!** If you have, for example, foil and non foil rows on your CSV, the extension will add them separately.

### Can some rows be wrongfully filled?
**It can happen!** I can't guarantee there are no bugs or issues in some older set tables / names, so it's possible it fails to fill the table correctly. **Always double check the filled form before submitting the cards for sale!** _I take no responsibility for mistakenly made listings._

### Is this extension allowed by Cardmarket themselves?
**Yes!** Although they have not checked / vetted the extension, I have confirmed with support that it was okay for me to publish it and it's okay for users to use.

### Can this extension steal my data?
Even though the extension is allowed to read and write specifically on websites where the url matches _\*://\*.cardmarket.com/\*/Magic/Stock/ListingMethods/BulkListing\*_, the extension **does not read or write over your personal information**. It simply reads and fills the table of bulk listing in order to do it's job!

The entire code is open source and you can verify it here; you can even clone this repository and launch it yourself locally if you don't trust the store version.


## Roadmap & Contributions
I have improvements planned when I find the time to work on them! Check the [TODO](docs/TODO.md) file for the planned upgrades.

I will accept contributions to this project. Open a pull request to the develop branch and I'll review it as soon as I can!
